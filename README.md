# FBI Crime Data Analysis

## Project Overview

This project performs an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a dataset related to FBI crime incidents. The objective is to analyze crime patterns, trends, and distributions using various visualization techniques. 

**Project Type:** EDA
**Contribution:** Individual
**Team Member:** ABINETHRI T

## Project Summary

This project aims to analyze FBI crime data to identify crime hotspots, understand seasonal crime patterns, and inform potential strategies for crime prevention and resource allocation. By exploring the data through various visualizations, the project provides valuable insights that can be used by law enforcement agencies and stakeholders to make informed decisions and address crime-related issues.

## Business Objective

The primary business objective is to conduct a thorough exploratory data analysis of FBI crime incident data to:

* Unveil hidden patterns and trends.
* Identify geographical areas with high crime rates (hotspots).
* Shape proactive crime prevention strategies.
* Allocate resources strategically to areas most in need.
* Identify recurring temporal patterns in crime occurrences.

## Data Source

The project utilizes two datasets:

* **Train Dataset:** `/content/Copy of Train.xlsx - Train.csv`
* **Test Dataset:** `/content/Copy of Test (2).csv`

## Data Wrangling

The following data manipulations were performed:

* **Data Cleaning:** Handling missing values, removing duplicates, and converting data types.
* **Feature Engineering:** Creating new features like 'Full_Date', 'Hour_of_Day', and 'Location'.
* **Data Merging:** Combining the test and training datasets for comprehensive analysis.

## Data Visualization and Insights

The project includes several visualizations (over 20 charts) following the UBM rule (Univariate, Bivariate, Multivariate analysis). Each chart is accompanied by explanations of:

* **Chart Type Selection:** Why a specific chart was chosen.
* **Insights:** Key findings and observations from the chart.
* **Business Impact:** How the insights can be used to create a positive business impact and any potential negative growth areas.

**Examples of Visualizations:**

* **Distribution of Years (Histogram)**
* **Distribution of Months (Line Plot)**
* **Distribution of Crime Types (Pie Chart)**
* **Incident Counts by Year, Month, and Crime Type (Heatmap)**
* **Crime Type Distribution by Neighborhood (Stacked Bar Chart)**
* **Crime Type Distribution by Top 10 Hundred Blocks (Horizontal Bar Chart)**
* **Crime Type and Month Word Cloud**
* **...and more**

## Tools and Technologies

* **Python:** Programming language for data analysis and visualization.
* **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, Geopandas, Wordcloud.
* **Google Colab:** Cloud-based platform for running the analysis.

## Conclusion

This project provides valuable insights into FBI crime data through extensive data analysis and visualization. The findings can be used by law enforcement and stakeholders to make data-driven decisions for crime prevention and resource allocation, ultimately contributing to enhanced public safety and community well-being.
